I am a researcher, reporter, and student. I **also** love the oxford comma. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### What am I studying?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/katherinef2/katherinef2.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
